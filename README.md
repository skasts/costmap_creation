# Costmap creation

This repo contains jupyter notebooks to project either `.stl` or `.pcd` 3D models into a 2-D birdseye view, put out as `.png`. Check out the `.ipynb` files, they should be self explanatory. The `.png` can then be manually postprocessed using GIMP to create a costmap for the 3D scene.
